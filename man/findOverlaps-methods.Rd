\title{Finding overlapping ranges in RangedSummarizedExperiment objects}

\description{
  This man page documents the \code{findOverlaps} methods and family
  (i.e. \code{countOverlaps}, \code{overlapsAny}, and \code{subsetByOverlaps}
  methods) for \link{RangedSummarizedExperiment} objects.

\S4method{findOverlaps}{RangedSummarizedExperiment,Vector}(query, subject,
    maxgap=0L, minoverlap=1L,

}

\arguments{
  \item{query, subject}{
    One of these two arguments must be a \link{RangedSummarizedExperiment}
    object.
  }
  \item{maxgap, minoverlap, type}{
    See \code{?\link[GenomicRanges]{findOverlaps}} in the \pkg{GenomicRanges}
    package.
  }
  \item{select, ignore.strand}{
    See \code{?\link[GenomicRanges]{findOverlaps}} in the \pkg{GenomicRanges}
    package.
  }
}

\details{
  These methods operate on the \code{rowRanges} component of the
  \link{RangedSummarizedExperiment} object, which can be a
  \link[GenomicRanges]{GenomicRanges} or \link[GenomicRanges]{GRangesList}
  object.

  More precisely, if any of the above functions is passed a
  \link{RangedSummarizedExperiment} object thru the \code{query} and/or
  \code{subject} argument, then it behaves as if \code{rowRanges(query)}
  and/or \code{rowRanges(subject)} had been passed instead.

  See \code{?\link[GenomicRanges]{findOverlaps}} in the \pkg{GenomicRanges}
  package for the details of how \code{findOverlaps} and family operate on
  \link[GenomicRanges]{GenomicRanges} and \link[GenomicRanges]{GRangesList}
  objects.

\value{
