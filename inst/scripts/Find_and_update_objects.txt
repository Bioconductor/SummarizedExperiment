Find and update objects
=======================

This document describes the procedure for finding and updating serialized

  cd <dir/you/want/to/scan>

      grep -Ei '\.(rda|RData)$' >rda_files

STEP 2: Prepare list of rda files to update.

  cd <dir/you/want/to/scan>
  R CMD BATCH prepare_list_of_rda_files_to_update.R \
             >prepare_list_of_rda_files_to_update.log 2>&1 &

STEP 3: coming soon...
